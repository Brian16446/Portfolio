        <h3>About this project:</h3>
        <p class="project-info">
            This was the first project I worked on as part of a team and as such it is the biggest project I've worked on so far. Above are screenshots of a few of the pages from the website. 
            <br/>This project was for my final coursework for my second year of university. The goal was to take a design brief and create a website that offered the functionality specified which included a signup/login system with different levels of users and the creation of quizzes from plain text files.
            <br/>This project taught me a lot about web development, how to work as a team towards one end goal. I also learned how to break down a large scale problem into smaller tasks and prioritise them.
            <br/>It actually took a while for us to learn to work effectively as a team as we were friends and thought it would be easy. We realised that we were making very little progress each week and needed to ramp it up and work more efficiently. 
            I was the leader of the group and found that we worked best when we were together and had a list of small tasks that we worked on. We would book the group study room in the library for 4 hours a week and I took post-it notes and wrote the tasks that needed to be completed on them and stuck them to a wall. Each week we had about 20 small tasks or bugs such as "redirect user when sign in fails" or "sign up to course doesn't work as tutor".
            <br/>We would each take a note off the wall, work on it, put it on a pile when we'd completed it and then grab another. This made sure we weren't working on the same thing and also gave us a nice indication of what we had to done and what we had done. It felt good as time progressed and we saw the board getting smaller and the pile on the table getting bigger and gave us a surge of motivation.
            <br/>For the last half hour, we would combine our work and make sure that we had no errors and reviewed what we had left to do. Some tasks made us aware of other tasks that needed to be done or bugs that needed to be fixed, so we would write down what we realised we needed to do and then next week work off that list. 
            <br/>The end result was a website that functioned really well, although we could definitely have improved some aspects of the website with more time.
